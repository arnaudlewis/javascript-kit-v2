* Client-side with a simple script tag

### Starter kits

For new project, you can start from a sample project:

* [Node.js blog](https://github.com/prismicio/nodejs-blog)

### Demo project

You can find an integration of prismic content with the new API V2 in the following project:
* [Node.js project](https://github.com/arnaudlewis/prismic-apiv2)

### Usage

To fetch documents from your repository, you need to fetch the Api data first.

```javascript
var Prismic = require('prismic-javascript');

Prismic.api("http://your_repository_name.prismic.io/api", function(error, api) {
  var options = {}; // In Node.js, pass the request as 'req' to read the reference from the cookies
  api.query("", options, function(err, response) { // An empty query will return all the documents
    if (err) {
      console.log("Something went wrong: ", err);
    }
    console.log("Documents: ", response.documents);
  });
});
```

All asynchronous calls return ES2015 promises, so alternatively you can use them instead of callbacks.

```javascript
var Prismic = require('prismic-javascript');

Prismic.api("https://your-repository-name.prismic.io/api").then(function(api) {
  return api.query(""); // An empty query will return all the documents
}).then(function(response) {
  console.log("Documents: ", response.results);
}, function(err) {
  console.log("Something went wrong: ", err);
});
```

See the [developer documentation](https://prismic.io/docs) or the [API documentation](https://arnaudlewis.github.io/javascript-kit-v2/globals.html) for more details on how to use it.

#### Install the kit locally

Source files are in the `src/` directory. You only need [Node.js and npm](http://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/)
to work on the codebase.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Documentation

Please document any new feature or bugfix using the [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) syntax. You don't need to generate the documentation, we'll do that.

If you feel an existing area of code is lacking documentation, feel free to write it; but please do so on its own branch and pull-request.

If you find existing code that is not optimally documented and wish to make it better, we really appreciate it; but you should document it on its own branch and its own pull request.
